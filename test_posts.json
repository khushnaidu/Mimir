An example of instability putting our troops at risk is Yemen. Houthis are launching missiles at commercial traffic and as a result, the US Navy was sent out to protect shipping lanes. One incident almost resulted in one of US Navy's ships almost getting blown up and it had to activate its last line of defense. \n\nWith so many kids dying, not to mention all the food we used to give out, instability will follow.

It's a powerful position, and for any cardinal electors who may be turned off by his American nationality, it's not his only one. Prevost is a dual citizen of the U.S. and Peru, where he served for many years.\n\n> Overall, **he's considered a centrist**, but on many social issues he's seen as progressive, embracing marginalized groups like Francis, who championed migrants and the poor. But Prevost opposes ordaining women as deacons, for instance, so he's seen as conservative on church doctrine.\n\n> His age could also be a factor \u2014 at 69 some may consider him too young to hold the church's highest office.",

        "body": "As per [original article](https://www.thedailybeast.com/pam-bondi-spilled-jeffrey-epstein-secrets-to-bogus-nanny-at-brunch/) \ud83d\udcf0:\n\n- Days before she announced \u201cthousands of videos\u201d of evidence in the Jeffrey Epstein case, Attorney General Pam Bondi was secretly recorded sharing the information with a woman at a restaurant pretending to be a nanny.\n\nThe woman turned out to be wearing a hidden camera for O\u2019Keefe Media Group, the latest venture of MAGA provocateur James O\u2019Keefe.\n\n[O\u2019Keefe shared a 15-second clip of the video](https://x.com/JamesOKeefeIII/status/1920625663012127191) Thursday showing Bondi eating brunch in a restaurant. A woman who had just approached her asks, \u201cDo you know when the Epstein files are going to get released?\u201d\n\n\u201cUm, we hope soon,\u201d Bondi answers. \u201cThe FBI has been on them.\u201d\n\n\u201cOK, any dates?\u201d the woman presses as Bondi tries to ignore her and keep eating.\n\n\u201cNo, you know what it is, though? There are tens and thousands of videos and it\u2019s all with little kids. So, they have to go through every one [of them],\u201d Bondi says.\n\nThe video doesn\u2019t show what happened before or after those few lines of conversation.\n\nO\u2019Keefe, the founder of Project Veritas, has been accused for years of publishing videos that are deceptively edited to misrepresent their subjects. In 2023 he was forced out of the company he founded and sued for allegedly bullying staff and misusing funds. Around the same time, he was also the subject of a criminal investigation.\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to the Department of Justice for comment.\n\nDuring his segment, O\u2019Keefe said the woman wearing the hidden camera had identified herself as a nanny, though he didn\u2019t say how or why that came up in conversation. Bondi doesn\u2019t have any children.\n\nBut on Wednesday, nine days after O\u2019Keefe says the recording was made, Bondi told reporters about the videos for the first time.\n\n\u201cThere are tens of thousands of videos of Epstein with children or child porn,\u201d she said at a press conference. \u201cThere are hundreds of victims, and no one victim will ever get released. It\u2019s just the volume, and that\u2019s what they\u2019re going through right now.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Keefe claims Bondi made the announcement after his team reached out to her on May 1 revealing the hidden camera recording and asking why the American people had never been made aware of the videos.\n\n\u201cWe would love the opportunity to sit down with the Attorney General to get further clarification\u201d on her comments, O\u2019Keefe Media Group wrote in an email.\n\nIn an article on his website, O\u2019Keefe wrote that \u201cno formal response was provided,\u201d without elaborating. Days later, Bondi later used almost the exact same wording during Wednesday\u2019s press conference, the article said.\n\n\u201cDoes this show that a government apparatus is still working behind the scenes to protect powerful people involved in the scandal?\u201d O\u2019Keefe said during his segment revealing the secret recording.\n\nFor months Bondi has vowed to release new bombshell evidence in the case of Epstein, the American financier and sex offender who killed himself in jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.\n\nShe faced a MAGA mutiny in March after releasing binders full of \u201cnew\u201d information that turned out to be mostly documents that were already publicly available. At the time, she blamed the FBI for not providing anything revelatory.",

He called it YEARS before Snowden did his leaks.   \n\nHe called the Epstein ties a decade (or more) before the 2019 arrest.  \n\nHe called out \u201chuman/animal hybrids).  While I\u2019ve not seen proof of the extremes of what he claimed, we have seen human cells be out in to pig embryo.  So\u2026 at least half right.  \n\nHe called out weather modification.  Yes, it was publicly disclosed as early as the 1950s. But back then, you trusted the government, right?  And the science was likely less understood and overall, less known by the masses.  He made it widely known, which in my opinion is a great thing. \n\nHe also called out the strangeness of Bohemian Grove about a year before infiltrating a ceremony and filming. \n\nI don\u2019t care if Jones\u2019 demeanor and how he never slows down to really explain himself.  But without nuts like this, no one would be pushing the envelope to get much of this secretive stuff out.

It\u2019s a laughably stupid symbolism, one that only works for those deeply committed to their ignorance about how the economy actually works: in truth, everyone consumes, and people of all genders participate in the productive economy. But Trump does not argue based on the facts: he asserts dominance. And here, he casts those Americans who would complain about the economic pain that he is inflicting on them as feminine and hence as contemptible, deserving no more respect than spoiled children.\n\nhttps://archive.is/wip/8GZlI",

        "body": "On Friday, Donald Trump abruptly removed the three sitting Democrat appointees on the five-person U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission \u2014 the independent watchdog agency that issues recalls and regulates everyday products, including consumer electronics. With no apparent cause for removal, the firings violate existing Supreme Court precedent dating back to 1935, as did Trump\u2019s removals of the Democratic commissioners of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) back in March.\n\nThe firing comes in the wake of a draft budget proposal that would have eliminated the CSPC, whose commissioners are bipartisan by law and who serve five-year terms. The proposal would have instead rolled the commission\u2019s regulatory powers into the Department of Health and Human Services, which is led by a political appointee \u2014 presently, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.\n\nRead more from Sarah Jeong and Tina Nguyen: [https://www.theverge.com/news/664498/consumer-product-safety-commission-cpsc-trump-firing](https://www.theverge.com/news/664498/consumer-product-safety-commission-cpsc-trump-firing)",

        "body": "Starter Comment:\n\n\nPresident Trump has characterized the recent slowdown at U.S. ports, triggered by his administration\u2019s new tariffs on Chinese goods, as a positive development for the American economy. **He argued that reduced port activity means the U.S. is losing less money to China and suggested that not doing business with China might be better for the country**. Trump also reiterated his desire for greater access to Chinese markets for American businesses, framing the tariffs as a necessary step toward fairer trade and increased competition.\n\n\nHowever, port officials and industry experts warn that the sharp decline in cargo volume-especially from China, which now faces tariffs as high as 145%-could have serious economic consequences. The slowdown is already leading to fewer work hours for dockworkers, truck drivers, and those in related industries, with some major retailers halting shipments from China altogether.\n\n\nShipping companies are canceling scheduled sailings at rates surpassing even those seen during the pandemic, and the Port of Los Angeles expects a 35% drop in incoming cargo for early May. These disruptions threaten to ripple through the broader economy, potentially affecting jobs, supply chains, and the availability and price of consumer goods.\n\n\nDo you find Trump's continued misunderstanding of trade deficits and basics economics concerning? These comments suggest that the Tariffs will not be removed anytime soon as he continues to double down on them despite measurable negative economic impacts piling up.\u00a0",

    "text": "The Pentagon is removing the 1,000 members of the military who openly identify as trans, and giving those who have yet to openly-identify as transgender 30 days to remove themselves, according to a new directive issued Thursday.\n\nThe memo is fueled by Tuesday\u2019s supreme court decision allowing the Trump administration to enforce a ban on trans military members. The defense department has said it will follow up by going through medical records to identify others who haven\u2019t come forward.\n\nOfficials have said that as of 9 December 2024, there were 4,240 troops diagnosed with gender dysphoria in active duty, national guard and reserve service, representing a tiny fraction \u2013 of the 2 million people in service, although they acknowledge the number may be higher.\n\nThe memo released on Thursday mirrors one sent out in February, but any action was stalled at that point by several lawsuits. When the initial Pentagon directive came out earlier this year, it gave service members 30 days to self-identify. Since then, about 1,000 have done so.\n\nIn a statement, Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell said the 1,000 troops who already self-identified \u201cwill begin the voluntary separation process\u201d from the military.",

The sources did not want to be named because they work for the U.S. government and fear for their careers.\n\nU.S. authorities on Thursday were trying to arrange a charter flight that would bring the South Africans to Dulles Airport near Washington, D.C., on Monday morning, but it's not clear if they will be allowed to land there. If that is not possible then they will be sent on commercial flights, according to the sources.\n\nNPR has also seen an email confirming the plan, and that the new arrivals will then be sent on to their final destinations in various states across the country.\n\nThe group are the first group of Afrikaners to be accepted by the U.S. after President Donald Trump signed an executive order in February offering them possible resettlement.\n\nThe sources said a press conference was planned for the group's arrival at Dulles airport, which would be attended by high level officials from the Departments of State and Homeland Security.\n\nStates that have agreed to take in the South Africans include: Colorado, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Washington, West Virgina, California, Idaho, Montana, North Carolina, Nevada, and New York, one source said. Several of the people granted refugee status have family ties in the U.S., they said.\n\nThe source noted it is unusual for refugees to be welcomed at the airport by U.S. dignitaries, and said the process of interviewing them in South Africa and granting them refugee status has been unusually quick.",

An earlier article from the WSJ mentioned that 2/3 of the cardinals were handpicked by Pope Francis in order to continue his more progressive policies.\n\nWhere do you think Pope Leo will guide the church politically? Is he progressive like Francis or will he depoliticize the church in social politics, especially after the Vance visit and the rise of right wing politicians across the West?",

Once elected, she then instructed her army of prosecutors to scour through every one of his business records until she found something to nail him on. Of note here is that the decision was made to prosecute him before any crime was even identified. Probably the most flagrant and high profile case of clear political prosecution in the history of the United States. When called out on her political motivations she simply shrugged and famously insisted \"nobody is above the law\" implying that her motivations are irrelevant because TeChNiCaLLy there was a low level crime committed, and she found it! Haha gotcha! The crime of overvaluing your property to secure better loan terms. Something that is commonly done in the industry and authorities typically turn a blind eye to and rarely bother to go after, especially when there are no victims and no complaints.\n\nAnd in this case there were no victims or complaints whatsoever. Deutsche Bank, the bank whom Trump supposedly overvalued his assets with in order to secure a more favorably termed loan from, went on the stand and insisted that they didn't believe Trump intentionally deceived them, stated that a lower valuation of his property wouldn't have changed their decision to loan him money or the terms, and doubled down by saying they would be happy to continue doing business with him without reservation. They made a lot of money and lost nothing. Letitia James didn't care, the fact the \"victim\" of the case insisted they weren't bothered by the Trump Organization's practices and had favorable things to say about doing business with him actually pissed her off even more and made her hell bent on railing Trump with a 450M fine for a victimless \"crime\". Her goal of putting Trump's head on a spike at all costs was gleefully given the nod by a jury comprised of 9 registered democrats in a kangaroo court in the deepest of dark blue districts of NY. She wanted her political prosecution and she was damn well going to get it.\n\nLo-and-behold, fast forward to today and she is found to have engaged in almost the exact same \"crime\" of fudging the nature of her real estate holdings in order to secure better mortgage loan terms for herself. And now she is crying and squealing like a stuck pig about how going after her is a politically motivated prosecution. You can't make this level of irony up, like holy shlt.\n\nWhat is it they say again? ... those who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.",

        "body": "It's true, but at the same time I kinda get the general dissatisfaction that is surfacing, even though I didn't come around to actually verbalize it very well. But, basically, people feel bad about their lives and feel the problem comes from degradation of material condition rather than the drudgery of the modern work environment. Overall, people are gradually becoming more miserable, and it's remarkable that the US (the unquestionably strongest Western economy over the last decade) has such a high share of people wanting to enact radical change while a lot of stagnating economies in Europe have much healthier politics. In my humble opinion, the increasing intensity of the worload (while work hours have mostly stayed the same) is the main culprit.\n\nBeing born in the early 90s, I have felt this drastic (and, IMHO, not talked about nearly enough) change in the number of people trying to \"minmax\" their lives and their hobbys. In the past, the world used to be a place where knowledge moved slow and simply knowing something (even relatively trivial) was worth quite a bit more because publicly-available resources were very scarce. Applied to the job market, it mostly meant that finding a niche was a lot easier than it is nowadays. Having a nice skill that few people had could often translate into a decent job with small workload. Frankly, most people were very mediocre at their job and their immediate environment was mostly fine about that because there were a lot fewer points of comparison.\n\nNowadays, people are a lot more aware of the \"industry standards\", which skills are in demand, etc. To top it off, there are a lot more resources available to skill-up ... Thus the set of \"rare skills\" has shrunk a lot, and those that remain rare are often legitimately very hard to learn and more often than not require to have some kind of special talent to be able to beat the competition.\n\nThe not-so recent hype for CS/SWE degrees is pretty much a textbook example of that. It used to be the case that any person with a decent knack for programming could become a SWE and have a decent to very good job (moderate workload, high pay).\n\nBut, nowadays, the proficiency that is required to make it has become a lot higher and the hiring process has become very competitive for juniors. Sure, that translates into skyrocketing productivity (people have become a lot better at their job on average...), but I don't think the majority of decent but not top-talented workers are so happy about that.\n\nWhile it is at its most extreme in the tech world (for many reasons, chief among them the fact that techbros are VERY online), it remains true for all tertiary sector jobs. In my own little corner, the expected quality of work has increased A LOT over the last decades, and I'm pretty sure we're not inherently better than our predecessors ... We just chafe through it, being slightly helped by modern tools which themselves have to be learned. There remains this perpetual feeling of \"Go, go go!!\", always having to be updated about the latest thing, and fearing that the information that you're relying on will become outdated extremely fast. Top it off with extremely available stimulation, and there remains less time available for human connections and long term projects...\n\nI'm not pretending my thesis is the right one, and the lack of housing definitely is a major economic contributor for the general malaise. But there IS still a problem, and it seems unlikely that the problem can be explained by material scarcity while living standards have overall strongly improved over the last two decades.\n\nSimply put, it's a fact mental health in Western countries has been degrading quite a bit since the mid-2000s. People are broadly more stressed, feel -and probably are- unhealthier. Ideologically, they also are clearly more cynical/nasty than they used to be.\u00a0Middle-aged people in particular seem to be particularly be angry about the way the world has changed (while old people mostly seem unphased). Frankly, I kinda get it. Juggligng your first (hopefully not too) serious health problems with the current workplace environment seems very hard and a recipe for anger.",

China now vastly outproduces the U.S. in key sectors like steel, cement, electric vehicles, and shipbuilding, raising concerns among experts and policymakers. The Trump administration has recognized the need for industrial revitalization but has responded with erratic policies-imposing tariffs on allies, cutting scientific funding, and discouraging skilled immigration-rather than building coalitions or investing in innovation.\n\n\nThompson draws a provocative parallel between Trump\u2019s approach and Mao Zedong\u2019s disastrous attempts at forced industrialization in mid-20th-century China. Both are characterized by a cult of personality, ideological purges, and a willingness to undermine established institutions and expertise in the name of populist fervor. Trump\u2019s rhetoric, such as urging elites to work in factories and advocating for economic sacrifice (like rationing toys and school supplies), echoes Maoist campaigns that prioritized ideological conformity over practical progress.\n\n\nUltimately, the article warns that this \u201cMAGA Maoism\u201d risks dismantling the very advantages-world-class universities, scientific leadership, and global alliances-that have underpinned American power. By alienating talent, slashing research, and undermining state capacity, the U.S. could be ceding its future to China, ironically imitating the failed strategies of Mao\u2019s China rather than effectively competing with its modern, industrial might.\n\n\nDo you agree with the parallels being drawn between the current MAGA political ideology and Maoism? Will this ideology ultimately backfire and undermine America's long term world standing?",

Your last ditch is that it keeps wages from going down as fast as they would otherwise go. I\u2019ll now drive you out of that ditch. If your theory means anything it means that the union will last, at least, as a brake. Now you know that periodically men are laid off by the thousands, and hundreds of thousands. These laid-off men want to live; they will offer themselves for a lower price. If your union strikes it goes to smash, if it does not strike it melts to smash, so that, even as a brake, the day is at hand when your unions will exist no more.\n\n>*Pro-unionist*\u201d\u201cYou have hit me hard. Perhaps you think you have knocked me out. But you have not. As sure as a man will raise his hand by mere instinct, to shield himself against a blow, so surely will workingmen, instinctively, periodically gather into unions. The union is the arm that labor instinctively throws up to screen its head.\u201d\n\n>Unquestionably both the pure and simple pro-unionist and the anti-unionist are knocked out. They have knocked out each other.\n\n>The pro-unionist\u2019s last statement is a knockout blow to the man who imagines that the union is a smashable thing.\n\n>On the other hand, the anti-unionist\u2019s argumentation, whereby he brings out the fact that the union\u2019s claims of potential triumph are false, and that, driven from defeat to defeat, the union can gather for the next defeat only, knocks out the pro-unionist. That is to say, the pure and simple pro-unionist.\n\n>In their mutual trituration the materials are gathered with which Socialism can build the four-jointed truth. Let us now take the \u201ctail\" and \u201ctrunk\u201d and \u201clegs\u201d and \u201cears\u201d and \u201cbody\u201d of the elephant as furnished us by these two typical disputants, and construct the animal. The disputants\u2019 positions will be found to be, not inherently irreconcilable, but fully reconcilable.\n\n>Starting from the principle, an undeniable one, that the spirit of union formation is an instinctive one, the question immediately presents itself: Is there no way by which the instinctive motion of self-defense can be rendered effective? Does it follow that because the man who raises his hand to protect his head from the threatened blow with a crowbar, has both his arm and his skull crushed, that therefore the instinctive motion of self-defense might as well be given up? The question suggests the immediate answer. The answer is no, it does not follow. And the question, furthermore, indicates what does follow. It follows that the arm which periodically is thrown up in self-defense, must arm itself with a weapon strong enough to resist\u201dat least to break the blow.\n\n  \nTL;DR - they need us, so when we gather as working people to defend ourselves we go from defeat to defeat but ultimately we will never stop gathering on this principle under capitalism, and eventually socialism will be the demand less we wish to continue resisting toothlessly.",

The case drew national attention after video footage showed masked federal agents detaining Ozturk, sparking concerns about a broader crackdown by the Trump administration.\n\n\nJudge William Sessions III ruled that Ozturk\u2019s March detention was unlawful and appeared to be solely in response to an op-ed she wrote criticizing Israel in her school newspaper. The judge cited clear violations of her free speech and due process rights, stating, \u201cHer continued detention cannot stand.\u201d The 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals has ordered Ozturk be returned to Vermont by May 14.\n\n\nThis is another blow to the Trump administration and confirms previous reporting that the administration was going after student visa holders solely based on their\u00a0 speech. How should voters respond knowing that the Trump administration is not respecting the first amendment rights of all legal residents? Will this continue to drag down Trump's immigration support with voters?\n\n\nEdit: Link to Ozturks Op-ed that was the basis for her deportation by the Trump administration can be read here: https://www.tuftsdaily.com/article/2024/03/4ftk27sm6jkj",

        "body": "Article:\n\n\nA programme at Harvard Divinity School aspired to \u201cdeZionize Jewish consciousness\u201d. During \u201cprivilege trainings\u201d, working-class Harvard students were instructed that, by being Jewish, they were oppressing wealthier, better prepared classmates. A course in Harvard\u2019s graduate school of public health, \u201cThe Settler Colonial Determinants of Health\u201d, sought to \u201cinterrogate the relationships between settler colonialism, Zionism, antisemitism, and other forms of racism\u201d: Will these findings by Harvard\u2019s task-force on antisemitism and anti-Israel bias, released on April 29th, shock anyone? Maybe not. Americans may be numb by now to bulletins about the excesses, not to say inanities, of some leftist academics.\n\n\nIf so, one might hope that as Americans consider whether antisemitism is a problem at Harvard, they would imagine how it might feel to be a certain sophomore encountering this social-media post about herself, by a peer: \u201cShe looks just as dumb as her nose is crooked.\u201d The report, a door-stopping 311 pages, describes a campus culture so toxic that another undergraduate confided to members of the task-force, \u201cI feel lucky I don\u2019t look Jewish.\u201d\n\n\nNo doubt a task-force on racism or sexism on any Ivy League campus would find evidence of both. And, in fact, a separate Harvard task-force found that Muslim, Arab and Palestinian students have felt \u201cabandoned\u201d and even \u201cactively suppressed and repressed\u201d. None of that diminishes the seriousness of the problem of antisemitism on elite campuses as documented by Harvard\u2019s task-force and by one at Columbia University, or the particular, institutionalised quality this bigotry has acquired. \u201cWe are not aware of any other group on campus,\u201d the Harvard report on antisemitism reads, \u201cthat is subject to social exclusion as part of an intentional campaign by political organisers.\u201d\n\n\nThe Harvard task-force was formed following the campus convulsions after Hamas attacked Israel in 2023 and the war in Gaza began. But it tells the long story of Jews\u2019 relationship with the school, from grudging admission, constrained by quotas, to \u201ca golden age\u201d of inclusion from the 1960s to about 2010. After that, according to the report, the pro-Palestine movement hardened, increasingly regarding Israel as a pariah and at times ascribing \u201ca form of hereditary and collective guilt\u201d to American Jews over its actions, even its existence. \u201cThe slippage between \u2018Israel\u2019 and \u2018Jews\u2019 is widespread,\u201d the report notes. On campus and beyond, out of ignorance or malice, a trope is catching hold on the left that equates racism with Zionism, and thence with Judaism.\n\n\nDonald Trump has cancelled billions in combined grants to Harvard, Columbia and other universities. His pressure campaign is ostensibly rooted in alarm about antisemitism, but other concerns keep sprouting. On May 5th Linda McMahon, the education secretary, told Harvard it was barred from future grants, in a letter in the signature smashmouth style of this administration and the professional-wrestling league she ran. In more than two pages of insults and criticism about everything from plagiarism to hiring former New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, Ms McMahon referred only elliptically to antisemitism. Mr Trump\u2019s indignation about campus antisemitism was always hard to take at face value. He has contributed to the \u201cslippage\u201d by condemning Jews who vote Democratic as \u201cvery disloyal to Israel\u201d. He has failed to deplore antisemitism among his supporters. Those he pardoned for attacking the Capitol on January 6th included Nazi sympathisers, one of whom sported a \u201cCamp Auschwitz\u201d hoodie that day.\n\n\nMr Trump\u2019s approach is a poor match for the schools\u2019 troubles. Some Jewish officials, on campus and beyond, fear that Jews will bear the brunt of blame for Mr Trump\u2019s campus crusade, and that faculty and administrators will minimise the problem of antisemitism in reaction. His pressure will probably also make it harder for universities to make even common-sense changes. Columbia\u2019s trustees insisted that measures put in place after demands from Mr Trump were steps the school wanted to take, but the appearance of capitulation intensified the backlash.\n\n\nWhat is saddest, or maybe most laughable, is the implication that America\u2019s national politics (let alone the guiding light of Trump University himself) has anything to teach its undergraduates about grappling with complexity, nuance or the views of an adversary. Ms McMahon\u2019s letter, a model of hyperbole and animosity, is a masterclass in turning problems into political opportunities rather than helping solve them. In early May, a bill to define antisemitism for purposes of combating it on campus stalled in committee, as senators bickered over language they feared would make it a cudgel for one party or the other.\n\n\n**Muddle East**\n\nBy contrast, the self-scrutiny on campus is substantive. The task-forces at Harvard and Columbia have been thorough, and their recommendations are specific and far-reaching. Finding a need for \u201cprofound repair\u201d, Harvard\u2019s task-force made dozens of proposals, for everything from governance to discipline, to strengthen a \u201cculture of pluralism\u201d. Students, it reported, \u201ctoo often feel they are carrying the weight of their identities, since they say that is how they sold themselves to Harvard in the application process\u201d. Instead, applicants should be told to expect a \u201cgenuine community with people with whom one may disagree\u201d. When it came to the Middle East, the report acidly noted a \u201cshortage\u201d of courses \u201cmeeting Harvard\u2019s standard for intellectual excellence\u201d.\n\n\nIt is ridiculous that Harvard has to relearn lessons about the value of rigour in the classroom and the folly of reducing individuals to group identities. But at least the university is showing signs of buckling down. Mr Trump would be wise to do what he does well, and claim credit for this happy development, rather than try to teach the lessons himself.",

Race was not an issue for them then nor was it in the 2024 election.\n\nSexism is a cheap excuse, too. These voters with liberal values didn't turn away from Harris because of her sex, but because she largely represented an elitist, out-of-touch democrat party that dismissed the concerns of their own voter base, going too hard on luxury beliefs instead of everyday kitchen-table-issues that the middle and lower class were concerned with.\n\nI don't believe that the 6 million registered democrat voters that sat out the 2024 presidential election were racist nor sexist either. They had the same disenchantment as those that defected for this one election cycle, but they chose to \"vote\" via disengagement. They could not vote for Trump, but equally could not vote for Harris. The point of contention for these democrats was, aside from all the other grievances, that she won no party primary. Harris's \"win\" as the Democrats' presidential nominee was antithetical to democrat sensibilities because there was no primary and no voter participation of democrats as a whole. Instead, she was picked; her position unearned.\n\nI won't even get into how they hemorrhaged Union Voters, Black Voters, Latino Voters, Asian Voters, Women Voters (a near 50/50 split where as before, for decades, they maintained a large majority of this demographic). They even lost the Youth Vote! They shed demographics that had voted blue for DECADES and still Democrat leadership and the unwanted ghost of Biden remain tone-deaf to the wants and needs of their voter base, which intersects with Republican voters.\n\nThey need to stop victim blaming and take some time to seriously reflect on the 2024 loss. The democrats, frankly, need to suffer through their own internal civil war to hash out newer, younger, commonsensical leadership that goes back to advocating for the working, lower, and middle class as well as protecting the most vulnerable in our society: Children and the elderly. Set aside luxury beliefs and focus on what affects Americans day to day and build solid short term and long term plans and SHARE IT with the public. Right now, elitist, leftist activists are at the wheel of the Democrat party while the party itself continues to fracture and self implode. I have cautious hope for the future of the democrat party, as I see promising politicians on a slow rise, but their own party threatens to shut them down and out for having the audacity of listening to their constituents and acting on their behalf.",

Martin\u2019s nomination had been withdrawn earlier that day due to insufficient support in the Senate, particularly from Republican Senator Thom Tillis, who opposed Martin\u2019s previous defense of January 6 rioters . \ufffc\n\nPirro, has faced criticism for promoting baseless claims about voter fraud in the 2020 election. Her appointment has raised concerns about the politicization of the Department of Justice, given her lack of recent, relevant, experience and her history of controversial statements.\n\nMartin, a former chair of the Missouri Republican Party, was appointed as interim U.S. Attorney in January 2025 despite lacking prosecutorial experience\u2014making him the first in over 50 years in that role without such a background. His tenure drew intense scrutiny for his previous legal support of individuals charged in the January 6 Capitol riot and his association with the Patriot Freedom Project, an organization backing those defendants. As interim U.S. Attorney, he dismissed charges against several Capitol riot defendants and launched a review into how the office had handled those prosecutions, aligning with Trump\u2019s criticism of the original charges. Martin\u2019s frequent appearances on Russian state media also raised alarm, and Senate Judiciary Democrats filed a misconduct complaint citing ethical violations, including intimidation and conflicts of interest. Opposition from both Democrats and some Republicans, including Senator Thom Tillis, ultimately stalled his confirmation. \n\nDo you think Pirro is a good choice?",

        "body": "There's an unfortunate conflation of homelessness and drug addiction that always bothers me about these stories. Where I live, San Francisco, drug addiction is for sure a huge problem. We have a massively outsized overdose epidemic, despite an enormous harm reduction program, spending on free medical services, and free housing program. We've been following the progressive playbook for literally decades, and (I'd argue, as a result,) we have one of the highest overdose rates in the nation. [In 2023, 810 died of an OD, and in 2024, 635 died of an OD,](https://www.sfchronicle.com/projects/san-francisco-drug-overdose-deaths/) in a city of only about 800,000 people.\n\nOn top of all that, some addicted individuals genuinely cause lasting harm to public spaces. Take BART, the San Francisco Bay Area's regional subway system. My boyfriend doesn't ride BART anymore, and chooses a long commute by car, because of consistent problems with addicts smoking crack and other substances in cars. BART police are largely ineffective at solving this problem, despite recent efforts to increase security on trains. Also, we took a rare BART ride a couple weeks ago, the first for me in months, and an apparent addict screamed racial obscenities at a nice Chinese lady who tried to sit near him. He forced her to leave the car. I contacted the police, who were once again ineffective.\n\nThe problems don't end at public transit. When an addict takes over an area in a park, which in San Francisco are precious open spaces (we don't have backyards) that denies the taxpaying, rules-following public the use of those amenities. When an addict steals from a business, that hurts the community; at scale, it can cause grocery stores and shops to shut down, which hurts the community.  When addicts habitually steal Amazon packages and sells their contents illicitly, that erodes public trust and makes everyone callous.\n\nAnd let's not forget the trauma from people who have to deal with the problem: I had a conversation with an employee at my local grocery store just a few weeks ago. She witnessed an addict and shoplifter flee security and run straight into the path of a bus. It wasn't clear if the addict survived.\n\nAlso, acquiescence to public addiction hardens people's hearts, and starts them thinking that, well, maybe Trump sending the gang members selling these drugs to CECOT isn't so bad after all. \"Look at how bad San Francisco is run. Maybe there's something to the strongman who says he'll make everything safe again, and get these drugs out of here.\" It's not correct; Trump is far more dangerous than the addict problem in San Francisco, but it's not good to have such an easy recruitment scheme unchallenged by his opponents.\n\nCriminalizing homelessness isn't what I want. What I want is, when an addict commits a crime, we offer that addict a clear, immediate choice between an end to their drug use, with as much effective public assistance as we can afford, or we treat their crimes seriously, in the justice system: indictment, trial, and if found guilty, jail. I don't want addicts who don't commit crimes to be bothered or investigated at all.\n\nAll of that is, I think, pretty separate from the problem of ineffective housing. Which is super important, and we should do everything we can to ease restrictions on building.",

        "body": "> Roughly 771,000 Americans were homeless last year, more than any other year on record and an 18% increase from 2023. A national housing shortage is by far the biggest culprit, but the end of pandemic rental assistance, an increase in migration and natural disasters that displaced people also contributed to the surge. Only about 35% of homeless people in America sleep outdoors rather than in shelters or in temporary housing, but that is a higher proportion than most other places tracked by the OECD, a club of mostly rich countries. Rough sleepers are more likely than their sheltered peers to be homeless for long stretches of time. Many of them struggle openly with drug addiction and mental-health issues, which can make tent camps look and feel unsafe.\n\n> The entrenchment of homeless encampments has frustrated voters who wonder where the billions of dollars poured into fixing homelessness have gone, and politicians whose careers may ride on fixing the problem. A backlash is well under way. Last June the Supreme Court ruled in Grants Pass v Johnson that punishing homeless people for sleeping outside when they have nowhere else to go was not a cruel and unusual punishment, which is banned by the Eighth Amendment. At least 163 municipalities have passed camping restrictions since then, according to the National Homelessness Law Centre, an advocacy group. Almost a third of those bans are in California, which has both more homeless people than any other state and the highest proportion of rough sleepers. The result is a country that, city by city, is trying to end unsheltered homelessness by force.\n\n> To understand how these bans are being implemented, consider Fresno, where there are more homeless people in the region than there are beds. Residents report encampments they want cleaned up to the city via an app. A special team of police officers and sanitation workers investigate these spots and make arrests. Sergeant Steven Jaquez, who runs the team, argues that the camping ban gives his officers leverage. Violators can face up to $1,000 in fines\u2014an astronomical amount for someone living on the street\u2014or one year in jail. But in lieu of punishment they can ask police to take them to a shelter where they can inquire about housing or treatment. If they complete a rehab programme, their citation goes away. But if, like Ms Valenzuela, they refuse the offer, tickets can accrue. As of April 25th the city attorney\u2019s office had filed charges in 266 cases. Only 33 of them were resolved because the person charged had accepted services. How harshly people will be punished is still unknown: the first case to make it to trial was dismissed by the judge for taking too long.\n\n> Fresno\u2019s leaders consider the camping ban a success, and insist that unsheltered homelessness is declining. But the most recent official statistics are two years old. Dez Martinez was once homeless and now advocates for her \u201cstreet family\u201d in Fresno. She reckons people are just hiding from the cops by moving under highway overpasses and tying their belongings to trees. Jerry Dyer, Fresno\u2019s Republican mayor and its former police chief, doesn\u2019t mind if that is true. \u201cI\u2019m sure there are people that have now chosen places that are less visible publicly, which is not a bad thing\u201d for businesses, he offers, though he says he would prefer that people seek help. Yet if homeless people go into hiding it becomes hard to know how many of them there are. The city can claim success, but the problem may persist in the shadows.\n\n> Mr Dyer contends that it is more compassionate to coerce homeless Fresnans to accept housing or treatment than allow them to suffer on the streets. Despite their different political parties, he sounds remarkably like Gavin Newsom, California\u2019s Democratic governor, who argued that lower court rulings previously limiting enforcement against camps had \u201ctied the hands\u201d of officials. The Cicero Institute, a conservative think-tank in Austin, Texas, started by Joe Lonsdale, a tech billionaire, pushes a similar argument as it works to pass state camping bans. \u201cWe have a deep discomfort with forcing people to do things,\u201d admits Devon Kurtz, who studies homelessness at Cicero. But, he asks fairly, \u201cIs it okay to let them die out there?\u201d\n\n> That so many Republicans and Democrats are on the same side illustrates how frustration with the status quo has scrambled the politics of homelessness. Many on the left were once leery of clearing encampments for fear that breaking up communities and trashing people\u2019s belongings could be traumatic for them. That argument is little-heard these days. The risk is that these camping bans prove to be too big a stick, and eventually follow the same pattern as anti-vagrancy laws passed during the 19th century, filling jails and prisons with people whose crime is having nowhere to live. \u201cThere\u2019s a very sordid history of moving from criminalising people who are destitute, to then institutionalising them,\u201d says Dennis Culhane of the University of Pennsylvania.\n\n!ping YIMBY",

These rebuttals are indeed evidence against the persecution narrative. However, they are not strong enough on their own. The wealthiest strata within societies can and often have been targeted for vicious persecution in other countries.\n\nThe safeguard against that kind of persecution is a liberal democracy, with Constitutional protections against exploitation and institutions that implement the letter and spirit of the Constitution. Minority groups can leverage such institutions and laws to protect themselves, and, together with their wealth, that forms a much more secure protection against exploitation.\n\nSouth Africa is a liberal democracy. This liberal democracy has, on paper, [some of the best institutional designs you can find](https://qz.com/africa/1907952/why-ruth-bader-ginsburg-was-a-fan-of-south-africas-constitution). In practice, it has [weathered the severe tests of a populist challenge](https://www.thebulwark.com/p/south-africa-zuma-trump-democracy-authoritarian-corruption) ten years before it started happening in other parts of the world. And in the present moment, it has achieved the major milestone of a proportional-representation Parliamentary democracy - the transition to true power sharing. In 2024, the ANC lost its majority in Parliament. It is now unable [to even pass a budget](https://iol.co.za/news/south-africa/gauteng/2025-05-06-anc-begins-deliberations-on-revised-budget/) without the real input of coalition partners.\n\nThe goal of this post is to put aside the question of wealth and focus on politics and the political status of White South Africans within South Africa's democracy. Are they really able to exercise their rights within that democracy or not?\n\n# Demographics and History\n\nHere is a brief primer on White South African demographics and politics, for people without context\n\n* White South Africans make up about 7% of the population\n* White South Africans are divided into two groups: Afrikaners (descendants of Dutch people) and English (descendants of British settlers)\n* Afrikaners are the the numerical majority at about 60% of White South Africans\n* There are other much smaller White ethnic groups, including Portuguese, Greeks and Jewish South Africans (mainly descendants of 20th century immigrants from Lithuania)\n\nMost White South Africans vote for a party called the Democratic Alliance (DA). This is a cosmopolitan, urban, classical liberal party. It is descended from the small anti-Apartheid White parties that existed before 1994.\n\nBefore the Democratic Alliance, most White South Africans voted for the National Party, which is the party that created Apartheid. The anti-Apartheid predecessors to the DA never won an election during Apartheid. But after Apartheid, the National Party collapsed. It wasn't banned or anything. The party just fell apart. Most of the former voters of the National Party ended up voting DA. By adding National Party voters to its liberal core, and then adding a small number of Black voters to the resulting mix, the DA has grown to achieve 21.8% of the vote in the most recent general election.\n\nThe ideological core of the DA leadership is still largely White, classical liberal, anti-Apartheid White people. They can be tone deaf, paternalistic, and racially insensitive at times. But they are getting better in terms of racial sensitivity - the new crop of leaders are much more charismatic and approachable. The party leadership is still disproportionately White, as are its members, but it is diversifying gradually. It is not simply a 'White party' as its critiques claim. But it is not always as non-racial as it professes. What isn't much in dispute is that they are technocrats who run municipalities well and achieve clean audits consistently. \n\nThere is another organization you really need to know about: Afriforum.\n\nThe Trump administration's engagements have largely been driven by engagements with [Afriforum](https://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/comments/1jsuiom/who_is_influencing_trump_on_afrikaners/), which is not a political party. They are an Afrikaner conservative lobby group who have been influencing Trump and the Republicans going as far back as 2018. If we are being charitable, what they want is something like an Afrikaner Quebec. But they are adamant about it being in South Africa, and do not want Afrikaners to move to the United States or become Americans. This goal seems to have been lost in translation across the Atlantic.\n\nThe DA believe that the future for White South Africans is within South Africa, not in an enclave, but mixed up together with everybody else. Their ideal country would be liberal in economics and politics, emphasize rule of law and individual rights and governed under a non-racial federalism. This is not what Afriforum believes in and not what they want. Afriforum want distinct cultural communities and autonomy or self-determination for each community, defined culturally or ethnically.\n\nEven though Afriforum is not a political party, there is a political party made up of basically people from the same political heritage called the Freedom Front Plus (FF+). If White South Africans wanted the Afriforum formula, they could have voted from the FF+ over the DA at any point in the last 30 years. They did not. When the National Party collapsed, its voters broke for the DA. The DA beats the FF+ handily: one poll estimate the DA wins [over 70% of White votes](https://srfreports.co.za/reports/the-demographics-of-south-african-political-parties-voter-bases-home-language-and-race). Afriforum's supporters definitely overlap with the DA's right wing, but the majority of White voters have clearly expressed support for the DA's vision of their future and rejected Afriforum's grand plan.\n\nThis is the first takeaway from the piece. Whatever you are hearing in the news or on Reddit or wherever, you should remember that the 'Afrikaners' in the headline are usually just a specific organisation claiming to speak on behalf of all Afrikaners or, implicitly, all White people. The only organization that can actually claim to have a mandate from Afrikaners or White people as a whole is the DA. And they are invested in the idea that you win at the ballot and institutions.\n\nThe question is whether this belief is realistic. Do White South Africans really have a chance at participating fully in the political system or not?\n\n# Representation\n\nIn [the current cabinet](https://businesstech.co.za/news/government/780120/the-biggest-winner-in-ramaphosas-77-seat-cabinet-3/), there are 6 White South Africans out of 32 cabinet ministers. Including the President and Deputy President, who are both Black, the Cabinet is 6/34 = 17.6% White. This is more than double their share of the population.\n\n4 of these ministers are from the DA, 1 is from the FF+ and 1 is from the ANC.\n\nThe portfolios they run are:\n\n* Home Affairs (identity documents and immigration)\n* Environmental Affairs\n* Agriculture (excluding Land Reform and Rural Development)\n* Public Works & Infrastructure\n* Transportation\n* Correctional Services (Prisons)\n\nThere are also White South Africans represented as Deputy Ministers. The Deputy Speaker of Parliament is White. And, obviously, there are many MPs who are White, including some who chair Portfolio Committees. And of course, many judges are White. White professionals also staff major companies, NGOs and have professional roles that means that non-White organizations tend to rely on them to get things done. Rich White individuals like the Oppenheimer family and Martin Moshal also contribute generously to political parties.\n\nThis is the first time the DA is in Cabinet. Prior to the 2024 election, the ANC never had to work with anybody else because they always won majorities in Parliament. But in 2024 they achieved only 40%, and had to form a coalition. They chose to work with the DA and a few other smaller parties.\n\nThere are two smaller parties which a pro-market, business minded person of any race might join:\n\n* Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) \\[in the coalition\\]\n* ActionSA \\[not in the coalition\\]\n\nIFP is a pro-business, liberal-conservative party that used to be very popular amongst Zulu speakers in KwaZulu-Natal. That is still their base, but they are not the largest party in that constituency. Think of them as Zulu Tories, but they advocate for much more substantive involvement by traditional chiefs and kings while still being Constitutionalist and democratic. They are very protective of the land which the Zulu king holds in trust for Zulu people, and they [oppose laws like the Expropriation Act](https://ifp.org.za/newsroom/ifp-statement-on-the-signing-into-law-of-the-expropriation-bill-by-the-president/) as a result of their suspicion of the central government and a respect for private property rooted in conservative-traditionalist reasoning. IFP doesn't do as well amongst non-Zulu speaking voters because of their involvement in [violent conflicts](https://oxfordre.com/africanhistory/display/10.1093/acrefore/9780190277734.001.0001/acrefore-9780190277734-e-1104?d=%2F10.1093%2Facrefore%2F9780190277734.001.0001%2Facrefore-9780190277734-e-1104&p=emailAwP5DD3SPX7d2#:~:text=Summary,than%20fifteen%20thousand%20people%20died) against the ANC in the 90s.\n\nActionSA is a DA breakaway party, led by a self-styled Capitalist Crusader. Predictably, they often feud with the Democratic Alliance. But they have similar policies. They want to scrap some of the ANC's Black Economic Empowerment policies, which impose incentives and penalties to drive companies to have more diverse ownership structures, and [replace them with a community investment driven approach](https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2025-05-09-actionsa-unveils-plan-to-replace-broad-based-black-economic-empowerment/?dm_source=dm_block_list&dm_medium=card_link&dm_campaign=main).\n\nBoth IFP and ActionSA are open to White members and leaders. [Liezl van der Merwe](https://www.pa.org.za/person/liezl-linda-van-der-merwe/) is an Afrikaner woman who serves as an IFP MP. [ActionSA's Parliamentary caucus](https://www.actionsa.org.za/leadership/) is made up of 2 out of 6 White leaders. Their national chairperson, Michael Beaumont, is White. He is the person who actually speaks on behalf of the party most of the time.\n\nFinally, it's important to note that not all White people are liberals, centrists or right wing. Left-wing White people can vote for any of the left wing or social democratic parties including:\n\n* ANC\n* GOOD\n* EFF\n\nIt's worth noting that this is not the first cabinet with White people in it. In the past, there were several White MPs even under ANC majorities. They were just... well, members of the ANC. [Rob Davies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Davies_(politician)) is an example. He ran the powerful [Department of Trade and Industry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Trade,_Industry_and_Competition) from 2009 2019. This ministry is responsible for, amongst other things, affirmative action. So for an entire decade spanning the Zuma industry, the guy who oversaw South Africa's affirmative action policies was a White man!\n\nGOOD is a younger party, and a DA breakaway. It only has one seat in Parliament, but if it had a second its deputy leader is a White man by the name of Brett Herron.\n\nThe EFF is a surprising addition here, but the fact is that there is a small number of far left White people (probably only a handful) who do vote EFF. We know this because every election cycle the media like to interview one of them if its a slow news day. Also there *is* a White man who represents the EFF in Parliament. He is, in fact, an Afrikaner, and was an anti-Apartheid activist in his youth. [Carl Niehaus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Niehaus) was previously a member of the ANC, and even served as national spokesperson for the party for a few years, before he jumped ship to the EFF.\n\nWhite South Africans are well represented in the political system, but *only* proportional to their number and their ability to organize and coordinate with others. For some people, that equality can feel like persecution, but it's not. It's democracy. Given that most of our political parties have shown an ability and willingness to work with White individuals, and let them occupy positions of power and leadership, it is unreasonable to talk about the situation in South Africa as if White people have no recourse to South African institutions or political power. \n\nI'm not saying that 7% is the same as 60%. I'm saying that people talk as if White people can't even run for office and that's just not true. 7% is not 60% - unless you build a politics that can accommodate others and get you to 60% one way or the other. And that is, actually, a reasonable ask of any group.\n\n# Majority\n\nBack to the DA. So, their job is to build a coalition majority that can allow them to govern South Africa and implement policies that, in their view, will spur growth and make race and racism both a thing of the past - for all groups. So how are they doing?\n\nWell, as of May of 2025: very well.\n\nA poll commissioned by a think tank placed the [DA ahead of the ANC for the first time](https://irr.org.za/media/da-overtakes-anc-as-bread-and-butter-concerns-triple-party2019s-black-support-2013-irr) in the history of the poll. The result was basically a tie, and well within the margin of error, but it was received as an absolute political earthquake in South Africa.\n\nThe reason for this was because the ANC's Finance Minister proposed a 2 percentage point hike in VAT, and the DA (as well as the EFF) fought it. This action sent the ANC's popularity plummeting, and resulted in a healthy and clear bump for the DA (as well as the EFF).\n\nFighting against an increase in prices, whatever the merits of the argument, will always make a political party more popular.\n\nPerhaps too enthusiastically, some commenters have started asking whether the DA can actually [govern the country](https://www.news24.com/opinions/columnists/adriaan-basson/adriaan-basson-is-the-da-ready-to-govern-20250421) as the leading party. With this comes the natural thought that a DA government would likely mean South Africa having its first White President. This might sound completely unrealistic, but consider that Julius Malema of the radical Marxist EFF has threatened to bring about exactly that scenario if the ANC doesn't give in to his demands. He has said he would support a motion of no confidence to remove the ANC and abstain from the subsequent vote for a new President, [handing the DA the Presidency even before 2029 by his math](https://iol.co.za/news/politics/2025-04-29-malema-warns-ancs-arrogance-may-pave-the-way-for-steenhuisens-presidency/). He's saying all this in a kind of racist way, but he's still saying it.\n\nIt's worth pausing to appreciate the trajectory here, even if you find these prediction outlandish. The mere fact that they are being discussed openly is a stunning accomplishment, and a far cry from what many people around the world assume the politics of South Africa is like, as far as White people are concerned.\n\nOne year ago, people were wondering whether the ANC would give up power in the unthinkable scenario that they lost the majority. Now people are musing or dooming or threatening each other with the prospect of a White President in 2029. The ANC didn't switch on the money printers when the going got tough - before the election they implemented austerity and after the election they are no implementing tax increases across the income distribution. These tax increases, which the ANC billed as fiscally responsible, were defeated by [the DA and EFF together in court](https://www.news24.com/southafrica/news/court-halts-vat-hike-orders-godongwana-to-pay-da-eff-legal-costs-20250428). Is any of this what you would have predicted for South Africa, based on what you hear about the country?\n\nWhere we are today is that the DA is a party which is actually in Cabinet, is increasingly seen as a normal part of national politics, a partner to the ANC and a potential governing alternative. As soon as the ANC slipped up, the DA's support shot up to 30% - challenging the ANC. The prospect of a DA government before 2029 is probably just a fun thought experiment. The prospect of a DA government in 2029 is something entirely within the realm of reason if nobody does anything stupid.\n\n# Accidental Sabotage\n\nUnfortunately, the DA have a bit of a pattern. They do well in an election, and then something racial happens, and then people are spooked and they lose momentum.\n\nI want to remind you that if there is any organization that commands the mandate of White South Africans, it is the DA. But Afriforum, the conservative lobby group, has spread such deep misinformation in the US that both Congress and the Executive have proposed taking action against South Africa, ostensibly on behalf of Afrikaners.\n\nThe net effect has been that the lives of the DA ministers have been made harder, in my opinion.\n\nStart with John Steenhuisen, the party leader and Minister of Agriculture. After the first wave of Trump tweets about South Africa in early 2025, U.S. Congressmen wrote a letter encouraging Trump to take action against the \"ethnonationalist gangster regime\" of Cyril Ramaphosa by removing South Africa from AGO. Steenhuisen then had to pen a letter in [*Business Day*](https://www.businesslive.co.za/bd/opinion/2025-03-05-john-steenhuisen-agoa-exit-would-be-a-bitter-harvest-for-sas-citrus-industry/) explaining that the loss of AGOA would be disastrous for the citrus industry. The U.S. would probably exempt critical minerals from those tariffs, but not farming outputs. It would be farmers and farmworkers who would suffer immediately, and it is now Steenhuisen's job to juggle this mess. All of this drama was before the universal tariffs introduced by Trump.\n\nSteenhuisen's colleague at Basic Education is Siviwe Gwarube. Basic Education is an important portfolio - the ANC draws lots of support from labour unions, and public school teachers are a core part of that group. Gwarube needs as much space and political capital as she can to build a relationship with the unions over time. Schools are also such a tangible issue for millions of people across the country, that if she performs well in that role, it would result in a bump for the DA amongst the kind of people who do tend to be more centrist and pragmatic and less radical - parents of young children. She should not have the focus on the drama around the [BELA Bill](https://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/comments/1j1tvc7/afrikaner_nationalist_disinformation_deep_dive/). This fight is basically around the issue of language policies in school. Afriforum wants to prevent the government from being able to ask Afrikaans medium-only public schools to introduce an English medium if the demographics of the community are diverse enough that Afrikaans-only doesn't make sense. I have seen more extreme positions *in favour of* English-medium education being made by people on this sub - the BELA Bill is a nothingburger and not worth the time or political capital of the Minister.\n\nThen there is Elon Musk, who is trying to get a Starlink license in South Africa. The South African venture of SpaceX has run into the issue that Black Economic Empowerment laws require that such a large company must have at least 30% ownership by historically disadvantage groups in order to get a license. The ICT Minister is, again, a member of the DA, Solly Malatsi. He is trying to [find a work around for this](https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2025-04-10-minister-malatsis-bid-to-get-starlink-deal-into-orbit-is-weighed-down-by-opposition-gravity/) because he is eager to bring in Starlink as a way of bringing internet to poor communities. Something like that could be a significant and visible win for the DA. We don't have to debate the merit of these laws for empowering Black South Africans. My point is that Malatsi should have the time, space and political freedom to try and figure something out. But instead, Elon is tweeting and agitating that he is not being allowed to operate in South Africa only because he is not Black. \n\nThe DA is never going to get to govern South Africa if it is not given the space and political freedom to make short term compromises for long term power. The ANC also had to 'sell out' (i.e. compromise) to get where it eventually got. \n\nBut what's even worse than the pressure to spend time and political capital on relatively minor issues is the political framing.\n\nWe have seen that when the core issues are bread-and-butter and good governance, the DA does well. Why are Afriforum and other groups dragging the DA back to racially charged questions where it does badly?\n\nWhy do they want to make it seem like DA Ministers are there to help literally the richest man in the world, who *actually did* benefit from Apartheid era advantages as a White South African, get around the laws designed to include Black South Africans in the economy.\n\nAllow me to channel my inner median voter for just a second: \"Sure look these Whites are efficient at some things but immediately we let them in and America is sanctioning us and trying to interfere? What's with that? Like it doesn't even make sense. We did what the Americans wanted and we put their people in and now we're getting attacked for it. Like... make it make sense?\"\n\nFrom the viewpoint of the median voter, what is happening is exactly what people have always warned, worried and doomed would happen once you let the DA in: they just want more and more power and privileges for richer White people at the expense of poorer Black people, like [the AIDS patients](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c77887npl2mo) Trump and Musk defunded as an indirect consequence of all the anti-South Africa lobbying.\n\nEven if all you care about is the political advancement of White South Africans, this is all extremely stupid.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nSouth Africa is a rapidly consolidating liberal democracy where its racial and ethnic minorities have been able to acquire real power. Predictions of violent retribution against Whites have not come true for decades now, but the people who make those predictions never have to account for their errors. By contrast, we went from \"the ANC will never lose\" to \"they won't give up power peacefully\" to \"obviously they'll work with the EFF\" to \"they'll absorb and destroy the DA\" to \"maybe the DA will get more votes but the ANC will still be in charge\" in less than a year. Despite this, cynical attitudes refuse to budge and update their beliefs.\n\nI hope that the basic numbers I have shown will help those who know nothing about South African politics to realize that, at the very least, White people are so intimately involved in the political arena that the most outlandish claims of White oppression just can't be true. Even some of the more modest claims of oppression fall flat once you dig deeper. White South Africans are the richest group in the country, and have political power proportionate to their engagement and number. There are issues which affect them disproportionately, mainly owing to the *need* to undo the effects of Apartheid. Specific ANC policies to do that can be harmful or even outright unfair. But there is an enormous array of tools available to White South Africans to address these, from courts to legislature to Cabinet - and White South Africans *themselves* are well represented in all of these institutions. These tools are slow because South Africa is a democracy and White people occupy no special place ahead of others - they have to build coalitions to get what they want. They are doing that, but the very people claiming to help them are actually sabotaging the most serious organization making real headway.\n\nThe future of White South Africans is as one part of a diverse, multicultural, non-racial liberal democracy with a hopefully booming economy and a well entrenched culture of human rights and individual liberty. There is a real shot at building this society within our lifetimes, and we have come so far already. The challenges we are facing are not that big in comparison to what we have already overcome and compared to what our institutions and systems are equipped to overcome. But people have to actually have the basic decency to inform themselves and think critically, rationally, pragmatically and long term. We are not going to resettle 5 to 7 percent of a middle income country in another country, and not when that percentage is the most economically advanced and entrenched group in the country. These are not random farmers or destitute people with nothing to do and nowhere to go. They aren't leaving. \n\nAll of this is a waste of time and a distraction from the various serious politics of building a liberal coalition inclusive of but not privileging to White South Africans, which can deliver breakneck growth for everyone. Do that, and most of the concerns of most groups will be resolved within a decade. ",

Like he was already late and inflation was coming.  But she was telling him how terrible it would be if he raised rates.  (I wonder if she is on Trump's side now, with the push to lower rates(?)).

The USSR accomplished amazing things turning a peasant feudal society into sending the first man into space within the span of decades. At the same time the lack of accountability in the party is responsible for disasters like Chernobyl, and the prolonged invasion of Afghanistan. \n\nTLDR: how does a Marxist-Leninist government maintain centralized power without corruption within the party ",

I simply started showing up to their events. A rally at City hall, a meeting in support of a senior housing project, happy hours at bars and at restaurants etc. Just show up. Go to those LGBT and women focused events. Maybe send me or this thread an image of these women and LGBT focused events so we can determine how strictly they want to control who attends. \n\n\nCity council is a fantastic way to start. There you will meet people who are just like you regular people who are genuinely concerned about their local communities. Some of them might be Nimbys, just ignore them LOL. Why not simply go to a city council meeting and make a public comment talking about an issue that's important to you. Straight up just say \"hey we should not ban pride flags in our city.\"  Or \"We should clarify that we will not cooperate with ice\". Or \"we should reform some of our zoning codes so that we can build more apartments\". All politics is local, and local politics is the most under discussed aspect of the political climate in america. It's the least sexy but I would argue the most important political arena to be a part of because you can have the most impact per hour of your labor. in one year I have already had meetings with two of my five City Council Members including a council member who came to a lunch with my YIMBY friendse. Just show up to events and talk to people and then show up to more events and then talk to more people and then show up to more events and then talk to more people and then eventually you can plan events and then people can show up and you can talk to them. There are often local proxies for national issues. For example, my city wanted to discuss giving $4,000 to a gay pride organization so they can throw their June pride event. $4,000 is a drop in the bucket for the city that I live in compared to their multi-billion dollar yearly budget. And yet there were seven or eight deeply homophobic and Nazis residents who were at the city council meeting opposing the item. Likewise things like transportation, housing, climate Justice, fighting racism etc. all have local institutions which ought to be reformed. You could say \" wouldn't it be dope if we didn't arrest homeless people simply for being homeless?\" Genuinely, you could spend the rest of your life simply advocating in your town for homeless people to not be abused and that would be a fully worthwhile use of your time.  we need dedicated local volunteers like that. I was surprised to find so many members of the city government such as the managers the development directors and some City staffers who were very sympathetic to my cause but who couldn't necessarily speak out because of perceived NIMBY power and dominance in local politics. Just talk to people. I wish you the best of luck! Private message me if you want a more in-depth chat.",

    "text": "Poland and France have signed a new treaty upgrading relations between the two allies, including providing mutual security guarantees in the case of war.\n\nPolish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, who signed the document alongside French President Emmanuel Macron, described the treaty as \u201cgroundbreaking\u201d, noting that only Germany has a similar security pact with France and that it makes Poland an \u201cequal partner\u201d with its western allies.\n\nMacron, meanwhile, declared that the treaty \u201copens a new era\u201d not only for Poland and France, but also for Europe. \u201cFrom Brest to Krakow, Europe stands together,\u201d said the French president.\n\n\n\nFriday afternoon\u2019s ceremony took place in the eastern French city of Nancy \u2013 a highly symbolic choice as the region was ruled in the 18th century by deposed Polish King Stanis\u0142aw I, who became duke of Lorraine. The town hall in which the signing took place sits on Stanis\u0142aw Square (*Place Stanislas*).\n\nSpeaking afterwards, Tusk thanked Macron for \u201cdeciding that this meeting would take place in the most Polish city in France\u201d.\n\nHe also noted that they had deliberately chosen to sign the document on 9 May, which marks Europe Day \u2013 the anniversary of the Schuman Declaration that paved the way for the EU \u2013 and one day after the anniversary of the end of World War Two in Europe.\n\n\n\nFull details of the treaty are not yet available, but earlier on Friday, before departing for France, Tusk revealed that its most important element is \u201ca clause of mutual support in the event of an attack on one of our countries\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt is with great satisfaction that I can say that \u2013 unlike in the past, when we expected security guarantees from stronger countries \u2013 today we talk to the French as partners, as an equal and strong partner,\u201d he added. \u201cPoland is now in a much better position than at any other time in history.\u201d\n\nThere have been suggestions in recent months that\u00a0[France could extend its \u201cnuclear umbrella\u201d to protect allies](https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/03/10/poland-declares-interest-in-french-nuclear-deterrent-or-even-developing-its-own/), including Poland. Tusk noted on Friday morning that the new treaty would \u201copen up the possibility of cooperation\u201d in that area but that further talks would need to take place.\n\nMeanwhile, the treaty would also \u201cdeepen cooperation in the field of agriculture, the joint presence of Poland and France in space\u2026\\[and\\] defence technologies\u201d, added the Polish prime minister. Both he and Macron also mentioned cooperation in\u00a0[developing civilian nuclear technologies](https://notesfrompoland.com/2022/06/29/edf-signs-agreements-with-polish-firms-in-effort-to-develop-polands-first-nuclear-plants/).\n\n\n\nNews of the planned treaty was\u00a0[announced earlier this year](https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/03/28/polish-french-relations-have-gone-from-darkness-to-light-under-tusk-government-says-ambassador/), with France\u2019s ambassador to Poland, \u00c9tienne de Poncins, saying that it would put Poland on the same \u201cpremium\u201d level of relations with Paris as Germany, Spain and Italy.\n\nThe ambassador paid tribute to the strengthening of Franco-Polish relations under Tusk\u2019s government, saying they had gone from \u201cdarkness to light\u201d since the departure in December 2023 of the national-conservative Law and Justice (PiS) administration. PiS regularly clashed with European partners, including France.\n\nOn Wednesday this week,\u00a0[Tusk also hosted Friedrich Merz in Warsaw](https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/05/08/merz-visits-poland-on-first-day-as-new-german-chancellor/)\u00a0on the new German chancellor\u2019s first full day in office. The Polish premier declared that \u201cthe future of Europe really depends to a large extent on how this\u00a0[Weimar Triangle](https://notesfrompoland.com/2024/03/15/germany-france-and-poland-pledge-to-buy-weapons-for-ukraine-using-frozen-russian-assets/)\u00a0\\[of Poland, France and Germany\\] will work\u201d.\n\nTusk also noted today that Poland is currently negotiating with the UK to strengthen security cooperation. \u201cAmerica will no longer be the only protective umbrella. Europe must take responsibility for itself,\u201d Tusk told the\u00a0*Rzeczpospolita*\u00a0daily, though emphasising that relations with Washington remain vital.",

    "title": "Baraka arrested outside Delaney Hall as battle with immigration authorities escalates - New Jersey Globe",
    "text": "Today, the mayor of Newark was arrested outside the Delaney Hall private detention center by ICE. From the article, to provide some context:\n\n>According to the three representatives, after they had made it into the facility\u2019s parking lot over the initial objections of Delaney Hall officials, Baraka was told to leave, and he did. (Members of Congress have official oversight powers over such federal facilities, and thus were subject to different rules.) They said that officials then followed Baraka to the gates of the facility, where a number of protesters had gathered, and arrested the mayor \u2013\u00a0also a current Democratic candidate for governor \u2013 after a brief scuffle.\n\nAs of the article, I could find no details on what constituted \"a brief scuffle\", but according to ICE Baraka was detained for \"attempting to force entry\", which doesn't really jive with being arrested outside the grounds. ICE's [official statement](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2025/05/09/members-congress-break-delaney-hall-detention-center) is similarly bizarre:\n\n>NEWARK, NJ \u2013Today, as a bus of detainees was entering the security gate of Delaney Hall Detention Center, a group of protestors, including two members of the U.S. House of Representatives, stormed the gate and broke into the detention facility. Representatives Robert Menendez, Jr. and Bonnie Watson Coleman and multiple protestors are holed up in a guard shack, the first security check point.\u00a0\n\nThis is beyond strange, not for Baraka, but for the other specifically mentioned US Representatives.  The House has oversight over such facilities and have legal entry. Which, to note, they received *after* Baraka had been taken away.\n\nThis isn't the first gauntlet thrown; Baraka [filed a lawsuit](https://newjerseyglobe.com/judiciary/newark-says-private-prison-firm-is-illegally-renovating-migrant-detention-center/) claiming that the private firm building and installing the detention center in Jersey was doing so without a permit, a lawsuit that GEO Group, said firm, promptly disregarded and accelerated an open date from June to May.\n\nFrom my perspective there are two things at play here: ICE in-print disregarding oversight powers and denigrating representatives of the Federal government, even against their own subsequent actions, and the arresting of political opposition by a strongarm federal agency without near enough oversight and a track record of both incorrect and inhumane treatment of people. Baraka went through legal channels initially, joined duly present representatives with their permission, and was singled out among protesters to be arrested.\n\nI am personally strongly **strongly** against private detention centers, regardless of whether it's \"expedient\" or \"cheap\". How America treats its criminals is indicative of how it is trending towards treating its citizens.\n\nDo we need stricter rules on the interaction of Federal and local leadership? If Federal oversight is delayed for a Federal facility, should courts be the stopgap? What are your thoughts on private detention in America? What do you think are the bounds for ICE in terms of leeway, whether arresting a local leader or delaying duly present representatives of their mandate?",

Countering Iranian influence in the region.\n\nTo do so, it has two paths:\n\n* Strengthening an Arab/Sunni led coalition to contain Iran and its proxies.\n* Bolstering Iran's nemesis, Israel.\n\nThese strategies are not mutually exclusive. The previous Trump and Biden administrations were successful in encouraging Israel and multiple Arab states to normalize relations. This was one of the main reasons for Hamas to resort to the October 7th attack, as they felt that the world was forgetting the Palestinian cause.\n\nHowever, with the mounting brutality of the Gaza war, these goals have become increasingly incompatible. As anti-Israeli sentiment grows in the region, the US will become more dependent on Israel as its main Middle Eastern ally.\n\nI see the following risks:\n\n* The US is putting all its eggs in one basket. This increases Israel's leverage on us and makes America beholden to Israeli politics. Netanyahu and his party increasingly rely on the support of far-right and ultranationalist parties.\n* Israel's goals do not all align with ours. A greater Israel does not necessarily contribute to the US's wider goal of regional stability. It's maximalist military policy in Syria, nominally to secure the occupied Golan Heights and protect the Druze minority, could destabilize Syria's fragile provisional government. A return to anarchy would offer a breeding ground and launching pad for Islamist radicals bent on punishing the US.\n* The US's public image will be tied to Israel's. Views on Israel have soured across the globe, in particular among the Global South. This weakens America's credibility and influence, especially among emerging nations.\n\nFinally, given the potential annexation of Gaza and the permanent expulsion of its population - alongside Trump\u2019s repeated remarks about a \u2018Middle Eastern Riviera\u2019 - I can only conclude that U.S. foreign policy is increasingly driven by Trump\u2019s personal financial interests rather than by the nation\u2019s",

        "body": "> The UK and Swiss governments have outlined plans to encourage train companies to launch direct services between London and Switzerland, in an attempt to tap into booming demand for long-distance rail travel in Europe. The two governments on Friday announced a memorandum of understanding to \u201clay the groundwork for future commercial services\u201d, linking the two countries through the Channel Tunnel rail link. A direct service would aim to appeal to both business and leisure travellers and would cut the journey time from London to Geneva to about five hours, according to people in the industry. At the moment, the same journey takes about 7.5 hours by train with a transfer in Paris. A flight to Geneva from London takes about one hour and 40 minutes.\n\n> A direct rail service would present logistical challenges because of the need to build border infrastructure at Swiss stations and for any new operator to buy trains compatible with the Channel Tunnel\u2019s stringent safety rules. The governments said they would explore ways to overcome such barriers. One option being explored is to build temporary \u201cmodular\u201d border controls and security screening in the Swiss stations as this would reduce to keep costs down, one person involved said.\n\n> Demand for long-distance intercity rail travel in Europe has boomed since the coronavirus pandemic, in part because of passengers\u2019 environmental concerns around flying, according to industry executives. \u201cWe welcome steps to strengthen sustainable travel between the UK and Switzerland. This is a first step in a wider plan with our partners to grow connections in the greenest way,\u201d Gwendoline Cazenave, chief executive of Eurostar, said.\nStill, several executives cautioned that the barriers to entry on cross-Channel routes remained high, and that any new services between London and Switzerland would be years away. Albert R\u00f6sti, one of seven federal councillors in the executive arm of the Swiss government, said a London to Switzerland service would be an \u201cambitious goal\u201d but that it was \u201creally likely\u201d services would launch within five to 10 years.\n\n> The Swiss government said that stations in Geneva, Zurich, and Basel could take trains from London but that these would need to be fitted with border control facilities. Switzerland\u2019s federal transport department would present a plan to the central government next year on how this could work, it added. Eurostar is the only company that runs international trains from London to stations in France, Belgium and Holland. Swiss Federal Railways (SBB), the national rail company of Switzerland, said it welcomed the plan. It said the requirements for a direct connection, which would be in the 2030s at the earliest, would include investment in new high-speed trains.\n\n> Several other operators, including the Italian state railway and Richard Branson\u2019s Virgin Group, have applied for permission to launch their own services from London to the continent, in the most significant challenges yet to Eurostar\u2019s 30-year monopoly. The owner of the high-speed rail line from London to the Channel Tunnel, London St Pancras Highspeed, earlier this year unveiled financial incentives to encourage operators to launch more services between London and mainland Europe. Its chief executive Robert Sinclair said the agreement between the UK and Switzerland \u201cbrings us one step closer to direct high-speed services between London and Switzerland\u201d.\n\n!ping UK&EUROPE&TRANSIT",

While a historically oppressed group should engage with other groups, there is nothing wrong with wanting to engage on their own terms.\n\nFor something of an example; in the second half of the 20th century, many African groups and nations experimenting with socialism felt more comfortable working with and taking advice from Cuba rather than the Soviets. People in places like Angola, Mozambique, and Ghana felt that Cuba (as a formerly-colonized nation in which centuries in which imperialist agression, colonization, and the slave trade dominated), would better understand the specifics of their situation in a way that the Soviets (whom, rightly or wrongly, they tended to view as yet more white people with an agenda) ever could.\n\nYou cannot create true solidarity within the working class if a significant part of that class has reason to believe they are being taken advantage of or not being heard.\n\nThe framework of intersectionality arose out of black women feeling that, to paraphrase one of the early thinkers, \"All of the blacks are men, and all of the women are white,\" a critique of both of those movements.

One of the most vivid manifestations of this principle was the display of workers' achievements at the entrance of factories, collective farms, and industrial enterprises. Here, the Soviet people could see two boards: one honoring the udarniks (shock workers) and Stakhanovites, who exceeded production norms and embodied socialist labor heroism, and another highlighting those who lagged behind, serving as a constructive critique to encourage improvement.\n\nThis practice was rooted in the Leninist principle of \"kto kogo\" (who whom)\u2014who will outcompete whom in the struggle for progress. By publicly recognizing the best workers, the Soviet state not only rewarded individual dedication but also set a model for others to follow. The portraits of record-breaking Stakhanovites, smiling proudly beside their production statistics, were a testament to the possibilities of socialist labor when combined with enthusiasm and technological mastery.\n\nConversely, the display of underperforming workers was not meant as humiliation but as a collective call to action. In the spirit of proletarian solidarity, the goal was to motivate those falling behind to improve with the help of their comrades. Trade unions and party cells often organized mentorship programs, ensuring that backward workers received support rather than mere censure. This method reflected the dialectical approach of Soviet pedagogy: criticism and self-criticism (kritika i samokritika) were tools for growth, not punishment.\n\nSuch practices were part of a broader system of moral and material incentives under socialism. While capitalist societies relied on unemployment and wage cuts to discipline workers, the USSR used socialist competition\u2014combining public recognition, collective responsibility, and material rewards like bonuses, medals, and access to cultural benefits.",

    "title": "If you want to know, how exactly socialism produces poverty, how exactly politicians produce corruption and how to find a bravery to fight for your country and ideas you should read Alexey Navalny\u2019s memoir \u201cPatriot\u201d",
    "text": "Hi, I\u2019ve recently made a post about Javier Milei\u2019s book https://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/s/f9pz6HVaxm, so I decided that it is good idea to tell fellow libertarians about the books, which I think useful to read and which can give us some fresh, extra ideas and will expand our worldview. I also would like to have express my thoughts somewhere and it is a perfect place seems to me\n\nSo, as a person from Belarus, Navalny was a hero of my generation, he is a person why I am interested in politics, I deeply remembered how I, being a history geek teenager, first discovered his investigations in YouTube, about how politicians shamefully stealing money from people to build a mansions, buy yachts, hiring prostitutes, hypocritically sending their lovely children to receive education in West, while hating Europe and US in propaganda. I deeply remembered how I was watching with my family his return to Russia after poisoning, how we discussed with my classmates Putin\u2019s palace that Navalny discovered. I deeply remembered how reading his funny, sarcastic letters from prison(once, being in a punishment cell he wrote prank letter to prison administration to give him a cangaroo as a cell mate, and because of protocol they were obligated to send a response why they can\u2019t give him a cangaroo), gave me strength, hope and believe that everything will be great.\n\nAnd of course after his murder I was fully shocked, devastated, paralysed, cried for 2 days. But as Navalny himself said in case of his death: \u201cDon\u2019t give up. If they kill me that means that they are fear us and our large strength, which we can\u2019t recognise yet\u201d. And of course, when his memoirs was published I read them.\n\nIt is a great book. Brilliantly described his childhood and ordinary soviet live with its constant stagnation and hypocrisity in all aspects of life: rock-n-roll was recognised as \u201cdegenerative\u201d art, in the \u201cproletariat\u201d state profession of worker was recognised as the most shameful job by soviet society, because of regulations of prices there were deficit and long queues in shops, not saying about that such a simple things as a bubble gum or coca-cola were recognised as gold by soviet kids because they didn\u2019t exist in USSR. \n\nIn the book Navalny comes as an example of ordinary person, patriot, who just tired of that shit he sees and where his country is going so he decided to act. This is a really biography of fighter. He also is very frank about his mistakes he\u2019s done in his yearly ages, and as politician, what makes you feel empathy for him for telling truth about himself. But after autobiography there are his prison diary that hits really really hard, but it demonstrate how badass and strong he was.\n\nI highly recommend to read this book cause we should learn be brave and uncompromising to corruption from him. Like Navalny brilliantly said: \u201cSocialism can\u2019t produce anything. The only thing it is efficient in is only creation of propaganda and lies\u201d\n\nP.S: you also can ask me everything about him\n",

        "body": "**Libertarianism** is a political philosophy centered on the principle of individual liberty, advocating for maximal personal freedom and minimal government intervention. Here's a structured overview:\n\n### Core Principles\n1. **Individual Autonomy**: Libertarians prioritize personal freedom, asserting individuals should be free to act as they choose, provided they do not harm others or infringe on their rights.\n2. **Limited Government**: Government's role should be restricted to protecting individual rights (e.g., through police, courts, and military), often termed \"minarchism.\"\n3. **Free Markets**: Support for laissez-faire capitalism, opposing government regulation, subsidies, and heavy taxation. They argue markets self-regulate through competition and voluntary exchange.\n4. **Non-Aggression Principle (NAP)**: Initiating force or fraud is immoral. This underpins opposition to coercion, including taxation and most regulations.\n\n### Key Concepts\n- **Property Rights**: Viewed as fundamental; individuals have exclusive control over their possessions.\n- **Voluntary Association**: Interactions should be consensual, rejecting coerced arrangements (e.g., state-mandated programs).\n\n### Branches\n- **Minarchism**: Advocates for a minimal state limited to protecting rights.\n- **Anarcho-Capitalism**: Rejects all state structures, proposing private entities handle services like security and justice.\n- **Left-Libertarianism**: Less common, combines social freedom with communal resource ownership, distinct from mainstream libertarianism.\n\n### Historical Context\n- **Enlightenment Roots**: Influenced by John Locke\u2019s ideas on natural rights (life, liberty, property).\n- **Modern Thinkers**: Include economists Milton Friedman and Friedrich Hayek, philosopher Robert Nozick (*Anarchy, State, and Utopia*), and anarcho-capitalist Murray Rothbard.\n- **Political Movements**: The U.S. Libertarian Party, founded in 1971, promotes these ideals.\n\n### Political Positions\n- **Social Issues**: Support drug legalization, LGBTQ+ rights, and oppose censorship.\n- **Economic Issues**: Advocate tax reduction, privatization, and free trade.\n- **Foreign Policy**: Favor non-interventionism and peace.\n\n### Criticisms\n- **Inequality**: Critics argue minimal government exacerbates wealth gaps and undermines social safety nets.\n- **Practicality**: Skepticism about functioning without state infrastructure (e.g., roads, defense).\n- **Corporate Power**: Concerns that unregulated markets may lead to monopolistic abuses.\n\n### Key Figures and Institutions\n- **Thinkers**: Ayn Rand (Objectivism), Nozick, Rothbard.\n- **Institutions**: Cato Institute, Reason Foundation.\n\n### Misconceptions\n- **Not Anarchism**: Most libertarians accept some government, unlike anarcho-capitalists.\n- **Distinct from Liberalism**: Differs from U.S. progressives (who support regulation) and European classical liberalism.\n\nLibertarianism emphasizes voluntary interaction and personal responsibility, challenging both state overreach and coercive social structures. While internally diverse, its core tenet remains the primacy of individual freedom.",

Because I live in socialist dictatorship where you can find yourself in jail only for negative comment about authorities or be tortured just for peaceful protesting against rigged elections. Of course, because of that I turned pro-democracy ideas but looking to other countries that are recognised as democratic I thought that we are somehow being tricked. I noticed that people don\u2019t have responsibility for decision making process, their participation in ruling their country starts and ends one time in four years where they are obligated to choose \u201cthe less evil\u201d among oligarchs\u2019s puppets, who are differed only by their sponsors. Almost every politician is a gaslighting parasite sociopath, who cares only about his rating and wallet. \n\n\n\nBut there is one country that fully differs from anothers - Switzerland. I really think that their system is the best one: people have 4 referendums each year, and local referendums in their communities, little and decentralised state. People directly impact the future of their country, not giving their responsibility to vote and ruling the country to a politicians, who will make corruption backshade deals.  What you need to understand that freedom is also a right to mistake. And if people made a mistake they can easy revert their desicion. And making more mistakes makes you more responsible and experienced. They don't need a shepherd who will \"prevent a democracy from wrong decisions\", people need to feel that they can infulence, that they are responsible for their fate.\n\n  \nSo, I i intuitively came to conclusion that somoething like a swiss model is needed for the world, but I couldn't fomulate it. Everything has changed in 2023, when Milei came to power in Argentina. I was shocked because he was the first polician who said exacltly what I was thinking for a long time and that's how I discovered about libertarianism. Looking to improving economic situation and entering the Rabbit hole of Friedman \"Free to choose\" series, Hayek and Milei's books made me define myself 100% libertarian\n\n  \n2. Because look at any other alternative. Socialism absolutely failed, we had a centrury of existince of two systems: capitalism and socialism, in which system people could have afforded home to live, car and where people stayed in long-meter queues for food. And why nowadays democractic system sucks I sayed before. Plus it is only just system. Just think, which moral right I have to enforce people how to think, how to look, what to do, who they should love. The NAP, our main principle, says that as long as you don't violently meddle in my live, I won't do anything to harm you. But if you initiated aggression to me or my property, I will do evething that necessary to defend myself and my property",

Property taxes are state rent in disguise. You \u201cown\u201d land, but stop paying the tax and watch how fast that illusion shatters. That\u2019s not ownership\u2014it\u2019s perpetual servitude.\n\nI don\u2019t buy into the \u201cwe need to fund local services\u201d excuse either. We can debate models for voluntary association, usage-based fees, whatever\u2014but ownership should mean final, sovereign control. Not a never-ending bill from the Leviathan.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a moral rant\u2014it\u2019s rational. I think like a system. Incentives matter. Property taxes punish stability and reward transient behavior. And in the long game, that erodes liberty and weakens capital formation. It\u2019s like a quiet wealth reset every year, enforced by threat.\n\nI\u2019d rather build a future where high-agency individuals can opt out, innovate, and own things absolutely\u2014without the state\u2019s leash.

He had a severe bladder blockage and the cost of the emergency surgery wouldn't have guaranteed a chance the issue never arises again. The vet tech brought in Hobbes, he had to be sedated so he could be given an exam. Seeing my baby sedated and not moving broke me. We all got a chance to say goodbye and my sister and brother called in to say their goodbyes as well. I found a video Wednesday when I got home of Hobbes and me. We're on my bed and I'm petting his head and he raises his mouth to release his scent on my phone camera and when he laid back down with his paws kinda like t Rex arms his eyes said: \"I'm safe here with you\". So that made my day even more incredibly difficult. When I get gone anymore my house is quiet, there isn't a little kitty there to greet me and ask how my day was or who I can sit and play with tonforget about stress. \n\nBaby mine, don't you cry,\nBaby mine, dry your eyes\nRest your head close to my heart never to part\nBaby of mine\n\nFrom your head to your toes\nYou're so sweet, goodness knows\nYou are so precious to me,\nCute as can be, baby of mine.\n\nI've ordered things online as a way to cope. I've got a Keychain which you can print an image and the flip side has the saying: \"you were my favorite hello and my hardest goodbye\", a snow globe of a tabby cat(which he was one) reaching for the moon. Hobbes loved being active at night. And finally a stuffed animal at 28 so that I can have something thst looks like my cat and use that to grieve. The hardest part is getting up in the morning and expecting to hear little footsteps running to greet me. I find myself looking for him while I'm getting ready for work.",

    "title": "Why the US will lose the trade war with China",
    "text": "There\u2019s a lot of tough talk coming out of Washington \u2014 especially from those who think tariffs and trade restrictions will somehow bring China to its knees. But this thinking drastically underestimates what the U.S. is up against. A cold-eyed comparison of political systems, cultural endurance, and leadership priorities reveals why the United States is likely to lose this trade war in the long run.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s talk leadership. Xi Jinping is not a politician seeking approval every four years \u2014 he is a true authoritarian with an iron grip on power. Donald Trump, on the other hand, is an authoritarian in aesthetic only. He wants absolute control, but is still bound by courts, midterm elections, and public opinion. Xi isn\u2019t. There are no checks, no votes, no dissenting party platforms. He doesn\u2019t have to sell a tariff policy to a divided Congress or worry about backlash from business lobbies. In the U.S., CEOs call the White House. In China, they fall in line.\n\nAnd unlike in the United States, where a dip in the stock market or higher grocery prices leads to immediate political panic, the Chinese population has a long, generational memory of economic hardship. This is a society that endured the Great Leap Forward, the Cultural Revolution, and strict zero-COVID lockdowns \u2014 all of which caused severe disruption and suffering. And yet, they endured. There is a cultural tolerance for national sacrifice that simply doesn\u2019t exist in the U.S. where one bad quarter can tank an entire administration\u2019s popularity.\n\nThe structure of the Chinese government further cements their advantage. A one-party system means that once Xi decides on a course of action \u2014 be it retaliation, restriction, or economic isolation \u2014 there will be no internal pushback. In contrast, U.S. presidents have to contend with constant elections, opposition parties, court rulings, and a restless media cycle. Policy can change every four years in the U.S., but in China, the direction is unified and consistent.\n\nSome argue Trump won\u2019t back down because he\u2019s obsessed with looking strong. That\u2019s true \u2014 but it misses the fact that Xi is equally, if not more, committed to projecting strength. In fact, looking weak \u2014 especially on the world stage \u2014 is anathema to the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s entire legitimacy. If the U.S. expects China to fold under economic pressure, they\u2019re playing a game of chicken with a driver who welded the gas pedal to the floor. Xi will escalate just to avoid the perception of weakness, and unlike Trump, he doesn\u2019t have to answer to voters or headlines the next morning.\n\nIn the end, this isn\u2019t just about economics \u2014 it\u2019s about systems. China is structured for long-haul endurance and unilateral decision-making. The U.S., for all its strengths, is built for compromise, reevaluation, and political turnover. That\u2019s great for democracy, but not for winning a prolonged trade war with a centralized, authoritarian rival who can outlast and outmaneuver at every turn.",

A place where those in Revolution can meet members who want to help and join that cause.  It's a way to bring us all together.  It could do so much if done right that's why I'm enlisting the help of as many want to help.    ",

Lots of assertion that Hakim is purely speaking ideologically from \"my side good, your side bad\", but no evidence to back up the claim. Even goes so far as to say that we have the advantage of hindsight and that choices can be mistakes without being evil, yet doesn't seem keen on extending that possibility to the M-R pact - which is, of course, just as ideologically driven as he claims Hakim to be. As per usual, it's nothing more than projection.\n\nThe thing that irked me the most was his quoting Marx about how people are subject to the circumstances they find themselves in, and then immediately turning around and asserting that since Stalin was top dog that meant he didn't have to consider his circumstances. Couldn't really take his arguments serious after that.\n\n~\n\nIn case you're interested, here's some further [resources on the M-R pact](https://reddit.com/r/TheDeprogram/w/index/debunking/molotov-ribbentrop-pact?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) from the Deprogram sub (the podcast Hakim helps run).",

It would have been the worst of the 20th century in terms of tyrannical rule. Chemical Mind reacted and even debated the man. In terms of video quality. I do suggest watching it and making an assessment based on your own personal opinions",
