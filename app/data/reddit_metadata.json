Basically, they\u2019re looking at the idea of organizing school sports not by gender, but by performance. Skill level, ability, maybe stats. That kind of thing.\n\nIt sounds like a big shift, but the more I thought about it, the more it seemed... not that wild? Some sports already do this. Swimmers get placed by time. Runners too. Even with team sports, we already have varsity vs JV, and in club sports, you\u2019ve got travel teams vs rec. So it\u2019s not unheard of, it\u2019d just be the default structure instead of gender being the main divider.\n\nSupporters say it might actually make things more fair. Like, newer athletes wouldn\u2019t be up against kids who\u2019ve been training since they were nine and already have a private coach. At the same time, higher-level athletes could play against people who push them to get better, instead of steamrolling every game.\n\nBut then there\u2019s the political angle. The whole debate over trans athletes in school sports has become... loud. Some people think if we shift the focus to performance instead of gender, it might take some of the pressure off. Not solve everything, but maybe lower the volume a bit. Less of the \u201cwho belongs where\u201d fight and more of a \u201chow do you play\u201d conversation.\n\nStill, there\u2019s a bunch of open questions. Like, what does \u201cperformance\u201d even mean in a team sport like basketball? Who decides that? Can small schools even pull this off if they barely have enough kids for one team? And is this just sidestepping the deeper conversation about inclusion and identity?\n\nIt\u2019s not a clean solution. But it\u00a0*is*\u00a0an attempt to deal with a real problem in a way that doesn\u2019t just pick a side and yell louder. And honestly, that feels rare these days.\n\nCurious what others think.

But, basically, people feel bad about their lives and feel the problem comes from degradation of material condition rather than the drudgery of the modern work environment. Overall, people are gradually becoming more miserable, and it's remarkable that the US (the unquestionably strongest Western economy over the last decade) has such a high share of people wanting to enact radical change while a lot of stagnating economies in Europe have much healthier politics. In my humble opinion, the increasing intensity of the worload (while work hours have mostly stayed the same) is the main culprit.\n\nBeing born in the early 90s, I have felt this drastic (and, IMHO, not talked about nearly enough) change in the number of people trying to \"minmax\" their lives and their hobbys. In the past, the world used to be a place where knowledge moved slow and simply knowing something (even relatively trivial) was worth quite a bit more because publicly-available resources were very scarce. Applied to the job market, it mostly meant that finding a niche was a lot easier than it is nowadays. Having a nice skill that few people had could often translate into a decent job with small workload. Frankly, most people were very mediocre at their job and their immediate environment was mostly fine about that because there were a lot fewer points of comparison.\n\nNowadays, people are a lot more aware of the \"industry standards\", which skills are in demand, etc. To top it off, there are a lot more resources available to skill-up ... Thus the set of \"rare skills\" has shrunk a lot, and those that remain rare are often legitimately very hard to learn and more often than not require to have some kind of special talent to be able to beat the competition.\n\nThe not-so recent hype for CS/SWE degrees is pretty much a textbook example of that. It used to be the case that any person with a decent knack for programming could become a SWE and have a decent to very good job (moderate workload, high pay).\n\nBut, nowadays, the proficiency that is required to make it has become a lot higher and the hiring process has become very competitive for juniors. Sure, that translates into skyrocketing productivity (people have become a lot better at their job on average...), but I don't think the majority of decent but not top-talented workers are so happy about that.\n\nWhile it is at its most extreme in the tech world (for many reasons, chief among them the fact that techbros are VERY online), it remains true for all tertiary sector jobs. In my own little corner, the expected quality of work has increased A LOT over the last decades, and I'm pretty sure we're not inherently better than our predecessors ... We just chafe through it, being slightly helped by modern tools which themselves have to be learned. There remains this perpetual feeling of \"Go, go go!!\", always having to be updated about the latest thing, and fearing that the information that you're relying on will become outdated extremely fast. Top it off with extremely available stimulation, and there remains less time available for human connections and long term projects...\n\nI'm not pretending my thesis is the right one, and the lack of housing definitely is a major economic contributor for the general malaise. But there IS still a problem, and it seems unlikely that the problem can be explained by material scarcity while living standards have overall strongly improved over the last two decades.\n\nSimply put, it's a fact mental health in Western countries has been degrading quite a bit since the mid-2000s.

Here's a structured overview:\n\n### Core Principles\n1. **Individual Autonomy**: Libertarians prioritize personal freedom, asserting individuals should be free to act as they choose, provided they do not harm others or infringe on their rights.\n2. **Limited Government**: Government's role should be restricted to protecting individual rights (e.g., through police, courts, and military), often termed \"minarchism.\"\n3. **Free Markets**: Support for laissez-faire capitalism, opposing government regulation, subsidies, and heavy taxation. They argue markets self-regulate through competition and voluntary exchange.\n4. **Non-Aggression Principle (NAP)**: Initiating force or fraud is immoral. This underpins opposition to coercion, including taxation and most regulations.\n\n### Key Concepts\n- **Property Rights**: Viewed as fundamental; individuals have exclusive control over their possessions.\n- **Voluntary Association**: Interactions should be consensual, rejecting coerced arrangements (e.g., state-mandated programs).\n\n### Branches\n- **Minarchism**: Advocates for a minimal state limited to protecting rights.\n- **Anarcho-Capitalism**: Rejects all state structures, proposing private entities handle services like security and justice.\n- **Left-Libertarianism**: Less common, combines social freedom with communal resource ownership, distinct from mainstream libertarianism.\n\n### Historical Context\n- **Enlightenment Roots**: Influenced by John Locke\u2019s ideas on natural rights (life, liberty, property).\n- **Modern Thinkers**: Include economists Milton Friedman and Friedrich Hayek, philosopher Robert Nozick (*Anarchy, State, and Utopia*), and anarcho-capitalist Murray Rothbard.\n- **Political Movements**: The U.S. Libertarian Party, founded in 1971, promotes these ideals.\n\n### Political Positions\n- **Social Issues**: Support drug legalization, LGBTQ+ rights, and oppose censorship.\n- **Economic Issues**: Advocate tax reduction, privatization, and free trade.\n- **Foreign Policy**: Favor non-interventionism and peace.\n\n### Criticisms\n- **Inequality**: Critics argue minimal government exacerbates wealth gaps and undermines social safety nets.\n- **Practicality**: Skepticism about functioning without state infrastructure (e.g., roads, defense).\n- **Corporate Power**: Concerns that unregulated markets may lead to monopolistic abuses.\n\n### Key Figures and Institutions\n- **Thinkers**: Ayn Rand (Objectivism), Nozick, Rothbard.\n- **Institutions**: Cato Institute, Reason Foundation.\n\n### Misconceptions\n- **Not Anarchism**: Most libertarians accept some government, unlike anarcho-capitalists.\n- **Distinct from Liberalism**: Differs from U.S. progressives (who support regulation) and European classical liberalism.\n\nLibertarianism emphasizes voluntary interaction and personal responsibility, challenging both state overreach and coercive social structures.

Because I live in socialist dictatorship where you can find yourself in jail only for negative comment about authorities or be tortured just for peaceful protesting against rigged elections. Of course, because of that I turned pro-democracy ideas but looking to other countries that are recognised as democratic I thought that we are somehow being tricked. I noticed that people don\u2019t have responsibility for decision making process, their participation in ruling their country starts and ends one time in four years where they are obligated to choose \u201cthe less evil\u201d among oligarchs\u2019s puppets, who are differed only by their sponsors. Almost every politician is a gaslighting parasite sociopath, who cares only about his rating and wallet. \n\n\n\nBut there is one country that fully differs from anothers - Switzerland. I really think that their system is the best one: people have 4 referendums each year, and local referendums in their communities, little and decentralised state. People directly impact the future of their country, not giving their responsibility to vote and ruling the country to a politicians, who will make corruption backshade deals.  What you need to understand that freedom is also a right to mistake. And if people made a mistake they can easy revert their desicion. And making more mistakes makes you more responsible and experienced. They don't need a shepherd who will \"prevent a democracy from wrong decisions\", people need to feel that they can infulence, that they are responsible for their fate.\n\n  \nSo, I i intuitively came to conclusion that somoething like a swiss model is needed for the world, but I couldn't fomulate it.

From the article, to provide some context:\n\n>According to the three representatives, after they had made it into the facility\u2019s parking lot over the initial objections of Delaney Hall officials, Baraka was told to leave, and he did. (Members of Congress have official oversight powers over such federal facilities, and thus were subject to different rules.) They said that officials then followed Baraka to the gates of the facility, where a number of protesters had gathered, and arrested the mayor \u2013\u00a0also a current Democratic candidate for governor \u2013 after a brief scuffle.\n\nAs of the article, I could find no details on what constituted \"a brief scuffle\", but according to ICE Baraka was detained for \"attempting to force entry\", which doesn't really jive with being arrested outside the grounds. ICE's [official statement](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2025/05/09/members-congress-break-delaney-hall-detention-center) is similarly bizarre:\n\n>NEWARK, NJ \u2013Today, as a bus of detainees was entering the security gate of Delaney Hall Detention Center, a group of protestors, including two members of the U.S. House of Representatives, stormed the gate and broke into the detention facility. Representatives Robert Menendez, Jr. and Bonnie Watson Coleman and multiple protestors are holed up in a guard shack, the first security check point.\u00a0\n\nThis is beyond strange, not for Baraka, but for the other specifically mentioned US Representatives.  The House has oversight over such facilities and have legal entry. Which, to note, they received *after* Baraka had been taken away.\n\nThis isn't the first gauntlet thrown; Baraka [filed a lawsuit](https://newjerseyglobe.com/judiciary/newark-says-private-prison-firm-is-illegally-renovating-migrant-detention-center/) claiming that the private firm building and installing the detention center in Jersey was doing so without a permit, a lawsuit that GEO Group, said firm, promptly disregarded and accelerated an open date from June to May.\n\nFrom my perspective there are two things at play here: ICE in-print disregarding oversight powers and denigrating representatives of the Federal government, even against their own subsequent actions, and the arresting of political opposition by a strongarm federal agency without near enough oversight and a track record of both incorrect and inhumane treatment of people. Baraka went through legal channels initially, joined duly present representatives with their permission, and was singled out among protesters to be arrested.\n\nI am personally strongly **strongly** against private detention centers, regardless of whether it's \"expedient\" or \"cheap\". How America treats its criminals is indicative of how it is trending towards treating its citizens.\n\nDo we need stricter rules on the interaction of Federal and local leadership? If Federal oversight is delayed for a Federal facility, should courts be the stopgap? What are your thoughts on private detention in America?

One of the most vivid manifestations of this principle was the display of workers' achievements at the entrance of factories, collective farms, and industrial enterprises. Here, the Soviet people could see two boards: one honoring the udarniks (shock workers) and Stakhanovites, who exceeded production norms and embodied socialist labor heroism, and another highlighting those who lagged behind, serving as a constructive critique to encourage improvement.\n\nThis practice was rooted in the Leninist principle of \"kto kogo\" (who whom)\u2014who will outcompete whom in the struggle for progress. By publicly recognizing the best workers, the Soviet state not only rewarded individual dedication but also set a model for others to follow. The portraits of record-breaking Stakhanovites, smiling proudly beside their production statistics, were a testament to the possibilities of socialist labor when combined with enthusiasm and technological mastery.\n\nConversely, the display of underperforming workers was not meant as humiliation but as a collective call to action. In the spirit of proletarian solidarity, the goal was to motivate those falling behind to improve with the help of their comrades. Trade unions and party cells often organized mentorship programs, ensuring that backward workers received support rather than mere censure. This method reflected the dialectical approach of Soviet pedagogy: criticism and self-criticism (kritika i samokritika) were tools for growth, not punishment.\n\nSuch practices were part of a broader system of moral and material incentives under socialism. While capitalist societies relied on unemployment and wage cuts to discipline workers, the USSR used socialist competition\u2014combining public recognition, collective responsibility, and material rewards like bonuses, medals, and access to cultural benefits.", "score": -3, "created_utc": 1746808994.0}]}, {"id": "1kipq11", "title": "About the International Anti-Fascist Forum in Moscow", "content": "", "subreddit": "socialism", "author": "Routine-Confusion-62", "score": 6, "num_comments": 1, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "engagement_score": 19.900000000000002, "created_utc": 1746815499.0, "url": "https://emdefesadocomunismo.com.br/sobre-o-forum-internacional-antifascista-em-moscou/", "is_original_content": false, "is_self": false, "link_flair_text": null, "top_comments": []}, {"id": "1kivr3i", "title": "If you want to know, how exactly socialism produces poverty, how exactly politicians produce corruption and how to find a bravery to fight for your country and ideas you should read Alexey Navalny\u2019s memoir \u201cPatriot\u201d", "content": "Hi, I\u2019ve recently made a post about Javier Milei\u2019s book https://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/s/f9pz6HVaxm, so I decided that it is good idea to tell fellow libertarians about the books, which I think useful to read and which can give us some fresh, extra ideas and will expand our worldview. I also would like to have express my thoughts somewhere and it is a perfect place seems to me\n\nSo, as a person from Belarus, Navalny was a hero of my generation, he is a person why I am interested in politics, I deeply remembered how I, being a history geek teenager, first discovered his investigations in YouTube, about how politicians shamefully stealing money from people to build a mansions, buy yachts, hiring prostitutes, hypocritically sending their lovely children to receive education in West, while hating Europe and US in propaganda. I deeply remembered how I was watching with my family his return to Russia after poisoning, how we discussed with my classmates Putin\u2019s palace that Navalny discovered. I deeply remembered how reading his funny, sarcastic letters from prison(once, being in a punishment cell he wrote prank letter to prison administration to give him a cangaroo as a cell mate, and because of protocol they were obligated to send a response why they can\u2019t give him a cangaroo), gave me strength, hope and believe that everything will be great.\n\nAnd of course after his murder I was fully shocked, devastated, paralysed, cried for 2 days. But as Navalny himself said in case of his death: \u201cDon\u2019t give up. If they kill me that means that they are fear us and our large strength, which we can\u2019t recognise yet\u201d. And of course, when his memoirs was published I read them.\n\nIt is a great book. Brilliantly described his childhood and ordinary soviet live with its constant stagnation and hypocrisity in all aspects of life: rock-n-roll was recognised as \u201cdegenerative\u201d art, in the \u201cproletariat\u201d state profession of worker was recognised as the most shameful job by soviet society, because of regulations of prices there were deficit and long queues in shops, not saying about that such a simple things as a bubble gum or coca-cola were recognised as gold by soviet kids because they didn\u2019t exist in USSR. \n\nIn the book Navalny comes as an example of ordinary person, patriot, who just tired of that shit he sees and where his country is going so he decided to act. This is a really biography of fighter. He also is very frank about his mistakes he\u2019s done in his yearly ages, and as politician, what makes you feel empathy for him for telling truth about himself. But after autobiography there are his prison diary that hits really really hard, but it demonstrate how badass and strong he was.\n\nI highly recommend to read this book cause we should learn be brave and uncompromising to corruption from him. Like Navalny brilliantly said: \u201cSocialism can\u2019t produce anything. The only thing it is efficient in is only creation of propaganda and lies\u201d\n\nP.S: you also can ask me everything about him\n", "subreddit": "Libertarian", "author": "MathematicianOk8124", "score": 9, "num_comments": 2, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "engagement_score": 19.7, "created_utc": 1746831373.0, "url": "https://i.redd.it/tr3xn8pi6uze1.jpeg", "is_original_content": false, "is_self": false, "link_flair_text": "Politics", "top_comments": [{"author": "jeschd", "body": "Thanks for putting this on my radar, I will try to pick this up soon and I\u2019d be interested to read more from Eastern Europe as well, let me know of any of your favorites that would be available in English.", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1746832115.0}]}]
