This suggests that too many requests have been made from the developer account within a specific time frame, exceeding the allocated limit for free usage.\n\nHere is some relevant discourse on this and related issues on Reddit: \n\nTwo Reddit threads from the subreddit 'moderatepolitics' and 'politics' provide discourse on tax-related matters. In the first thread, user 'Fried__Eel' initiates a discussion about a mixed model of taxation involving higher personal income taxes, especially for higher brackets, and lower corporate taxes. The responses vary with some arguing against soaking the rich as they believe it can harm the economy, citing Sweden as an example. Others suggest that corporate tax should ideally be zero, with revenue shortfalls compensated by increasing income and capital gains tax rates for wealthier earners. \n\nThe second thread revolves around a post by user 'aldotcom', discussing Donald Trump's issue with even a minor tax increase on the wealthy. The comments range from criticism of Trump's position to confusion over his stance, with some pointing out that he had recently suggested a tax hike for the rich. The overall sentiment appears to lean towards disapproval of Trump's tax policies and the perceived favoritism towards the wealthy."
